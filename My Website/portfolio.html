					   		<h2>About</h2>
					    	<p>This project I did for my artificial intelligence class. It lets a player play a game of tic-tac-toe against a computer opponent on a 3x3x3 cube. The computer uses alpha beta pruning to make its moves. There are some kinks to work out in the evaluation function. This is something I will continue to work on, so it might be in a different state when you get it.</p>

					   		<h2>About</h2>
					    	<p>This was a project I did for my capstone class. I decided to make something that related to one of my hobbies which is exercise. The goal was to make a fitness tracking website that also had social features. People in general have better results when other people are involved in their exercising. This was my first time using Ruby and Rails. It was quite the learning process. I found somethings very simple to do, but others seemed more dofficult. In the end I'm happy with the result as it was something I built from my own mind.</p>

						   	<p>The Startup Guild is a website that was built as part of the A100 program. The goal was to design 
						   	and build a community/jobs website for the startup community. This was a group project and I was put 
						   	in charge of front-end development. The site was not fully finished as the end goal of the project was 
						   	not to bring the site live, but to showcase skills.</p>

							<h2>About</h2>
						   	<p>I built this application in C# for myself. You can point it to a directory and give it a 
							destination directory. It will then search for any mp3 files in the directory and will move and 
							sort them into the destination directory. It sorts based on the meta information on the file 
							such as artist and album. It sorts it into a folder structure based on the artists and then 
							the album. If no folder exists for the artist and/or the album one is created. You can save the 
							results of the sort to a text file to keep as a record.</p>

						   	<p>Subway Tetris is part of my games research. I built this using C# and the Tao Framework
