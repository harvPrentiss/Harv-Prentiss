				<h1>Allow Mylself To Introduce ... Myself</h1>
				<p>My full name is Harold Charles Prentiss III. I go by Harold, Harry, or Harv the choice is yours.
					I am a software developer who wants to work on exciting projects that will test my abilities. I 
					like projects that require both down and dirty coding as well as some creativity. Both the left and right
					sides of my brain enjoy a good workout.</p>
				<p>I have been perfecting my coding craft since my junior year of high school which makes about 10 years 
					of practice. I am always expanding my knowledge on both the coding and design fronts. It has taken quite 
					some time for my design skill to gain ground on my coding, but it is getting there. One day I will have them in balance.</p>

				<h1>What I'm Currently Up To</h1>
				<p>I am attending Southern Connecticut State University to finish my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
				<p>On my never ending quest to learn more I have found a particular topic that has my interest. In my last semester here at SCSU
					I am taking an Artificial Intelligence class and I find it fascinating. The ways people have found ways to make computers appear to think
					is very creative and interesting. I feel in the public eye the individuals who do that work are held in the same regard as "rocket
					scientists". The fact that is a rapidly expanding field is just a bonus to learning about how it actually works. I may have found what I
					want to do for the rest of my life.</p>
