				<h1>Allow Mylself To Introduce ... Myself</h1>
				<p>My full name is Harold Charles Prentiss III. I go by Harold, Harry, or Harv the choice is yours.
					I am a software developer who wants to work on exciting projects that will test my abilities. I 
					like projects that require both down and dirty coding as well as some creativity. Both the left and right
					sides of my brain enjoy a good workout.</p>
				<p>I have been perfecting my coding craft since my junior year of high school which makes about 10 years 
					of practice. I am always expanding my knowledge on both the coding and design fronts. It has taken quite 
					some time for my design skill to gain ground on my coding, but it is getting there. One day I hope to have 
					my own web design company.</p>

				<h1>What I'm Currently Up To</h1>
				<p>I am attending Southern Connecticut State University to finish my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
				<p>I am a part of the <a href="http://gridnewhaven.com/a100" target="_blank">A100</a> Program at <a href="http://freeyourdata.net/" target="_blank">Independent Software</a> where we have been building projects to showcase to 
					local startup companies in the hopes of being hired for the summer as an intern.</p>
				<p>On my never ending quest to learn everything I have currently wandered into the backend web coding forest.
					It's dark and confusing, but I am starting to see light through the trees in the distance. In my trek through
					this forest I came across a Python, a Ruby, and something called PHP.</p>
